### Pre-built 3rd party libraries for ScummVM on Apple TV ###

This project contains libraries built for the Apple TV and Apple TV Simulator.
The target architecture for the Apple TV is arm64 while for the simulator arm64 and x86_64.

It contains binaries for the following libraries:

libFLAC
libSDL2_net
libcurl
libffi
libfluidsynth
libfreetype (concatenated with libbz2)
libglib-2.0 (concatenated with libintl)
libjpeg
libmad
libogg
libpng
libvorbis
libvorbisfile

Note 1:
Apple TV doesn't support forking of processes which means that libraries using forking are
compiled with that feature off (libmad and curl)

Note 2:
The libjpeg-turbo library for the x86_64 simulator is built with SIMD off. That will affect
performance but probably not noticeable.
